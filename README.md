# state-of-the-web

This is an article summarizing the recent years of innovation in the world wide web. In an environment where a lot of non tech companies have difficulties following the trends, the open source and tech startup world has moved on using web apps everywhere. We will try to review all the evolutions, from the now established such as front end frameworks to the bleeding edge such as web assemblies. An overview of the back end evolutions will also be given.

## Super-powered Browsers

This is probably what has changed the most. Once only able to display content, browsers (and W3C standards) have evolved to be fully capacitated environments, able to run offline applications, storing their data, in a fast and clean environment.

### Tons of APIs

#### Local Storage, and Session, and even Databases

#### Progressive Web apps

#### Web assemblies

### Universalization of the codebases

#### Less Competition

#### A diversity covered by an abstract layer

## Super diverse Servers

There was a time when PHP was the way a web server was built. Now every major language has the capacity of running web servers, with fully featured frameworks

### Convention Oriented Frameworks

#### J2E, Spring and ASP.net

#### Ruby On Rails, Django

### And then everything was the REST

### New Use Cases, new Databases

#### No SQL: The promise of a faster world

#### Redis: The promise of an even faster world

#### Each Database its use case

### Onto GraphQL

## The rise of JS

The avid reader will have noticed that we have so far not mentioned the language that pretty every new developper has to learn: Javascript. Well the truth is that so much changed for Javascript that it deserved its own 

### ES6, 7, 8 ...

### NodeJS

### Front End Frameworks

#### Angular

#### React

#### Vue

### Code it, Type it

#### Typescript

#### Flow

#### ReasonML

### One language to code them all?

#### Electron

#### React-Native
